This is a placeholder file to indicate where the integration architecture diagram should be placed.

In a real implementation, you would replace this text file with an actual image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.).

The integration diagram should illustrate:
1. Web Platform (Django)
2. Mobile Application (Android)
3. API layer connecting them
4. Data flow between components
5. Key integration points

Recommended dimensions: 1000px Ã— 700px
