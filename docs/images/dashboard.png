This is a placeholder file to indicate where the dashboard overview image should be placed.

In a real implementation, you would replace this text file with an actual image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.).

The dashboard image should show:
1. Main dashboard interface with screen time statistics
2. Device status indicators
3. Recent activity feed
4. Alert notifications
5. Quick action buttons

Recommended dimensions: 1200px Ã— 800px
