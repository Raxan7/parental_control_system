This is a placeholder file to indicate where the system architecture diagram should be placed.

In a real implementation, you would replace this text file with an actual image file (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.).

The architecture diagram should illustrate:
1. Web Platform (Django backend)
2. Mobile Application client
3. API communication layer
4. Database
5. How data flows between components

Recommended dimensions: 800px Ã— 600px
